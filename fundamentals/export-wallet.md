AutoMinter has integrated a third-party service called Magic Connect to enable users, collectors and creators to sign in using email and create a wallet - rather than require users to connect to the platform using their own crypto wallet eg. Metamask or Coinbase Wallet. This is particularly useful to onboard non-web3 natives. 

To Export your wallet, visit: https://wallet.magic.link and follow the steps explained in the video below.
