# Our Fees

Deploying your contract to the Ethereum (ETH) network with AutoMinter is 10x cheaper than a traditional smart contract. 

Ethereum Mainnet Setup Fee
There is a 0.05 ETH paid to AutoMinter and allow approx. 0.01 - 0.02 ETH paid in gas fees.

Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche + Other EVM Compatible networks
Deploying you contract on these networks are free from AutoMinter fees but you need to pay gas fees to the underlying network.

Primary Mint + Creator Earnings Fees
AutoMinter keeps 5% of the creators revenue from the primary mint and 5% of creator earnings fees* (eg. 0.5% where the royalty is set to 10%)

In the future, you may also be able to earn AMR tokens through the AutoMinter DAO, in return for your commission.

*Creator earnings are also known as 'creator royalties' or 'creator fees' and they typically range from 3%-10%.
